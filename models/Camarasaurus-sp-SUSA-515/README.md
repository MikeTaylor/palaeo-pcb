This directory contains 3D models of the pneumatic first caudal of the camarasaurusid SUSA 515. Files in this directory:

`CamTail1.stl` was a 3d model made (as I understand it) from a CT scan of the first caudal vertebra. It's omitted from the archive as it's very large (more than 2 Gb) due to containing internal detail that is not much use to us.

`CamTail1-one-tenth.ply` is the result of rendering `CamTail1.stl` down to one tenth the number of faces in MeshLab. This is small enough to keep around, but it's a very poor model: we think because  so many of the faces are wasted on representing invisible internal structure.

We will replace this with a decent downscaled model when we have one.

See also: the red-cyan 3D anaglyph that was rendered from snapshots of the high-quality module taken in MeshLab. It's Figure B in [the `figures` area](../../../figures).
