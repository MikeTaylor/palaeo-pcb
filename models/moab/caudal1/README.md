This directory contains 3D models of the pneumatic first caudal of the camarasaurusid SUSA 515. Files in this directory:

* `CamTail1.stl` -- a 3d model made (as I understand it) from a CT scan of the vertebra. It's currently omitted from the archive as it's very large (more than 2 Gb) due to containing internal detail that is not much use to us.
* `CamTail1-one-tenth.ply` -- the result of rendering `CamTail1.stl` down to one tenth the number of faces in MeshLab. This is small enough to keep around, but it's a very poor model: we think because  so many of the faces are wasted on representing invisible internal structure.
* _Still to do_ -- a decent downscaled model.

See also: the red-cyan 3D anaglyph that was rendered from snapshots of the high-quality module taken in MeshLab. It's Figure A in [../../../figures] the `figures` area.
